The overarching goal of the "GESTURE VOLUME CONTROL MASTER‚Äù 
project is to develop after the palm detection over the whole image our subsequent hand 
landmark model performs precise key point localization of 21 3D hand-knuckle 
coordinates inside the detected hand regions via regression, that is direct coordinate 
prediction. The model learns a consistent internal hand pose representation and is robust 
even to partially visible hands and self-occlusions.
